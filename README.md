# 🚕 Chicago Taxi Rides Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

## 🧠 Description
Several taxi companies in Chicago recorded data related to taxi ride requests, pickup and drop-off locations, trip destinations, and weather conditions at the time of each trip.

This project analyzes taxi trip data to understand ride patterns across different neighborhoods and to evaluate the impact of weather conditions on trip duration. In particular, the project focuses on testing whether rainy Saturdays affect the average trip duration from the Loop to O’Hare International Airport.

## 📊 Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
  The average trip duration from the Loop to O’Hare International Airport is the same on rainy Saturdays.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
  The average trip duration from the Loop to O’Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
